# Heart Disease Fuzzy Expert System

This is one of my final projects in the "Computational Intelligence" course at AUT. In this project, I've implemented a fuzzy intelligent system that can decide whether a person has a heart problem or not and at what grade is the problem.

- ### ECG
  
  A simple test that can be used to check your heart's rhythm and electrical activity. Its value is in range of [-0.5, 2.5]

- ### Maximum Heart Rate
  
  Maximum heart rate of the patient in past 24 hours in range of [0, 600].

- ### Exerciese
  
  A crisp set inidicating that exercise is allowed for the patient or not. If it has 0 value it means that exercise is not allowed for the patient and vice verca for 1 value.

- ### Old Peak
  
  Degree of oldpeak in range of [0,10].

- ### Thallium
  
  Amount of thallium in patient's body which can be 3 crisp values. (3, 6, 7)

- ### Sex
  
  Sex of the patient. 1 for women and 0 for men.

## Output Fuzzysets

We have one output parameter which is the health of the patient. It has 5 fuzzysets containing healty, sick1, sick2, sick3 and sick4.

## Rules

There is a [file](https://github.com/Amirparsa-Sal/Heart-Disease-Fuzzy-Intelligent-System/blob/master/rules.fcl) cotaining all rules of the inference engine. The rules can only contain and/or operators.
